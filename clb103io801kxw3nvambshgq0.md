# GitOps Fundamental: Is it worthy of your precious time?

Ever wonder why some people have GitOps Fundamental or GitOps at Scale Certification in their LinkedIn profile, well there's a really simple answer to it.

Well at first, let me explain what GitOps is. GitOps is a set of best practices applied from the beginning of the development workflow, all the way to deployment. In layman's term, it's just a faster way to do something. So do I think you are required to learn GitOps in order to succeed in the whole DevOps space. Absolutely not, but it's a nice and effective way to learn plus you get a certification for free in the case of [Codefresh](https://learning.codefresh.io/course/gitops-with-argo) which has free GitOps Fundamental and GitOps at Scale certification with a proper lab experience. BTW, this part of the article is not sponsored by Codefresh, it's all my experience.
